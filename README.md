Chaff OS
========
This is some crazy OS project i've been working on, on and off for some time now.

This is a 32-bit Unix-like OS which some day may become POSIX compliant. Currently it has many of the core parts including a memory manager, scheduler, process and signal management and general interrupts and exceptions.

The main parts of the **kernel** still to implement are

* I/O system
* Loadable Drivers
* [ELF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format) Loader
* System Calls (most calls just call other parts of the kernel)
